## Problem Statement:
Joe’s Hardware is a family owned hardware store located in the small town of Roswell. This family-owned business has been run by the Joes family for the last sixty (60) years, passing through three (3) generations of average Joes. With the emergence of big chain hardware stores who have been able to dominate the market shares due to their lower prices, it has become increasingly harder for Joe’s Hardware to balance their books and provide their customers with competitive prices due to a steady dip in their profits over the past few years. The Joes family decided that in order to keep their business afloat and be able to compete with the larger mass importing companies, they had to become more efficient.
With everything being done in-house and with an outdated time punch card system, over the years it has become harder to properly track an employee’s work hours. In order to save on payroll expenses and effectively track punches (ins, outs and breaks), they approached Honeypot Developers for a solution. They need a system that is able to digitally keep track of employees’ punches. It should also store employee records as well as current and past pay history. The accountant and managers as well as regular employees need to have access to this system and its information.
We, the developers, recognized the need for an integrated time management system that is user friendly and simple on the eye, however strong enough to be able to fill multiple roles for Joe’s family business. There would need to be access granted and denial capabilities to separate regular employees from senior management. The system should be simple enough to navigate so that even our simple Joes will find it usable. The system would need to be able to keep accurate time stamps and be able to match these stamps with employee logins. The ability to receive and store employee’s records digitally could save the Joes time, space and ultimately money.
